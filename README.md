High Performance DSA Solutions (Top Tech Level)

This repository contains advanced Data Structures & Algorithms problems curated from real technical assessments of top global tech companies.
Each problem focuses not only on solving the logic but also on achieving optimal time complexity.

1️⃣ Global Autocomplete System (Trie)
Problem:
Design a Trie-based system that stores up to 1 million strings and returns the top 5 most frequent suggestions for a given prefix.
Concepts Used:
   Trie Data Structure
   Prefix Search
   Sorting / Frequency tracking
Time Complexity:
 Insert → O(L)
 Prefix Search → O(L)

2️⃣ Streaming Max Analytics (Monotonic Queue)
Problem:
